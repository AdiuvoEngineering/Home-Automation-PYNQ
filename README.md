# Home-Automation-PYNQ
Repository for the Hackster project: Home Automation with PYNQ and Zigbee. 
This repository is for the code used. It contains the Jupyter Notebook. https://www.hackster.io/475906/home-automation-with-pynq-and-zigbee-f36d61

The idea of this project was that it's entirely possible to control Zigbee devices straight from inside the PYNQ framework. This provides some unqiue opportunties, such as creating Customised User Interfaces (UI), and utlize the PL in the ZYNQ for even more of a unqiue applications. 

Simply download the ConBeeAPI Jupyter Notebook and upload to the PYNQ board. Change the IP Addresses to match the PYNQ board IP. Run the first 3 cells this will attempt to generate a new API KEY if the ConBee is in Authenicating Apps Mode.
