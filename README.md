# Home-Automation-PYNQ
Repository for the Hackster project: Home Automation with PYNQ and Zigbee. 
This repository is for the code used. It contains the Jupyter Notebook. LINK HERE (LINK NOT PUBLIC)

The idea of this project was that it's entirely possible to control Zigbee devices straight from inside the PYNQ framework. This provides some unqiue opportunties, such as creating Customised User Interfaces (UI), and utlize the PL in the ZYNQ for even more of a unqiue applications.
